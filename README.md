# MSC
Mass Storage Controller for Teensy T3.6 and T4.x

This is a USB Mass Storage driver based on PJRC's USBHost_t36 library.

#THESE VERSIONS OF MSC ARE NOW OUTDATED!!
#The MSC driver is now included with Teensyduino 1.53 and above.
## DO NOT USE!!!
The second link is a modified version of UsbMscFat that was
modified By KurtE for using file date and time. Both KurtE and
mjs513 have contributed very much time and effort to these versions of the library.
The UsbMscFat library is still WIP and is trying to follow FS and
SD file abstraction with SdFat and MSC. But again things are changing
as development goes on.
Here is a link to UsbMscFat development:
